# ae370_project_2

This project uses the Crank-Nicolson method to numerically solve the one-dimensionally damped wave equation. It has files that contain the solver, the convergence plotter, a gif creator, and a python notebook to generate graphs to compare the effect of varying parameters when solving the equation.
